# ok-form

minimal js object validation

# Todo

- [ ] Sick Generics
- [ ] path
- [ ] Async
- [ ] .if? or just use if(x) return ok.validate();
- [ ] Babel target browsers?
- [ ] Search for OSS projects using joi / yup and see what validators they use
- [ ] Travis CI
- [ ] Bundlesize in CI
- [ ] See if formik wants to suggest it (check # of issues related to yup)
  - Want to help others, not just promote my stuff

# Why not...

## joi

Hard to set error msgs

## yup

converting string -> number is a pain
dsl for conditional validation is strange
circular references
